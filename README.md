# cli-esp-trainer 🧙‍♂️️

ESP trainer that runs in your terminal. The idea is inspired by [Russell Targ's ESP trainer](http://www.espresearch.com/iphone/) and is based on sound parapsychological study design.

## How it works ✨

1. There's 24 trials.
2. Each trial has four numbers to select from. You guess which number is going to be next.
3. If you're right, you score a hit.
4. If you're wrong, it's a miss. The correct number is displayed.
5. At the end, your results are tallied.

This trains you to distinguish an intuitive hunch from mental noise. True intuition should feel like a magnetic pull towards the correct number.

If your result is statistically significant, this is a clear indication of ESP. The scoring levels are 6, 8. 10, 12, or 14 hits. Frequently scoring 12 or more is considered highly developed ESP.

### Features 📔

#### Current

- Track your score against milestones of ESP ability
- Fast, minimal UI
- Cross-platform
- Coloured text
- Pretty table to display results

#### Future

- Ability to skip a trial
- Customise amount of trials
- Export results into .csv file
- Visualise improvements in results over time with charts
- Interactive shell (so you can play again without needing to reload the script)
- `--help` command to provide info from the terminal
- Code quality improvements (tests, linting)
- Website
- Public leaderboards

### Scientific evidence 🧪

The proof of ESP is out of the scope of this README. The evidence is extremely strong despite the controversy. Look at the work of both Russell Targ and Dean Radin if you're not convinced.

### Improving your score 📈

To improve your score, do consciousness work (especially meditation).

## Installation 🚀

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8.2 (lower versions of 3 will probably work, but haven't been tested)

### Instructions

Install the CLI client:

```sh
pip3 install esp-trainer
```

Run the script:

```sh
esp-trainer
```

## Development 👨‍💻

Install dependencies with [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

```sh
pipenv install --dev
```

Then open the project with your preferred editor.

Open the pipenv shell:

```sh
pipenv shell
```

That's it. Start coding.
